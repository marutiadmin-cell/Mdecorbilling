           pre-fills their usual rate (see historicalPrice above). Nothing is

                       macOS is the reason. With "Keyboard navigation" off —
                       the system default — Safari's Tab visits text fields
                       and skips buttons entirely, so tabbing off the Cash
                       pill reached neither "Full" nor anything else useful,
                       which is precisely the report. Driving the focus here
                       makes the run behave the same on every browser instead
                       of depending on a setting nobody at a shop counter is
                       going to find.
